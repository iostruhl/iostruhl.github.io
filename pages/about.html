        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I'm interested in computer systems, security, algorithms, and machine learning. I initially started with biology, which quickly led to computational biology, and then just algorithms and computer systems as I realized that I enjoyed questions in computer science the most. My industry experience comes primarily from Google, as a software engineering intern working on a large scale autocomplete service. I'm now one of three co-founders of <a href="https://distributedspectrum.com">Distributed Spectrum</a>, a Harvard-based startup that provides persistent radio frequency monitoring for defense and industrial applications.</p>
